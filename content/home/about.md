# About me

Hi, and welcome to my website! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Tilburg University, majoring in applied microeconometrics. I am particularly interested in applications within the field of health economics. My current research projects include quantifying the effects of price competition in the market for over-the-counter drugs and assessing ways to reduce bed-blocking in hospital care provision.

My supervisors are [Martin Salm](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/martin-salm) and [Jan Boone](https://janboone.github.io/homepage/). I expect to graduate in summer 2021.

I am affiliated with the [Health Economics & Management Knowledge Center](https://www2.novasbe.unl.pt/health) at Nova School of Business and Economics, Lisbon. I am also a member of the board of the Portuguese Health Economics Association.

Together with [Christoph Kronenberg](https://sites.google.com/view/christoph-kronenberg/home) I am organizing V-MESS, a virtual seminar on the economics of mental health. Click [here](https://sites.google.com/view/christoph-kronenberg/home/v-mess?authuser=0) for all the details.
