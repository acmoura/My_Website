# About me

Hi, and welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Tilburg University. My supervisors are [Martin Salm](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/martin-salm) and [Jan Boone](https://janboone.github.io/homepage/).

I am interested in health economics and applied microeconomics. In my {{% staticref "/files/MouraJMP.pdf" "newtab" %}}Job Market Paper{{% /staticref %}}, I study whether the entry of subsidized nursing homes and teams providing home-care reduces hospital delayed discharges. **I am on the Job Market and I will be available for interviews at the EJM and ASSA 2020/2021 online job market meetings.**

I am affiliated with the [Health Economics & Management Knowledge Center](https://www2.novasbe.unl.pt/health) at Nova School of Business and Economics, Lisbon. I am also a member of the board of the Portuguese Health Economics Association.

Together with [Christoph Kronenberg](https://sites.google.com/view/christoph-kronenberg/home), I organize V-MESS, a virtual seminar on the economics of mental health. Click [here](https://sites.google.com/view/christoph-kronenberg/home/vmess?authuser=0) for all the details.
