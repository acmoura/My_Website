# About me

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Tilburg University. I am interested in microeconometric applications within health economics. My current research topics include identifying the sources of regional variation in healthcare expenditures and competition in the market for over-the-counter drugs.

My supervisors are Martin Salm and Jan Boone. I expect to graduate in summer 2021.
