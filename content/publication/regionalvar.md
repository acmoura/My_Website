abstract = "We assess the relative importance of demand and supply factors as determinants of regional variation in healthcare expenditures in the Netherlands. Our empirical approach follows individuals who migrate between regions. We use data on annual healthcare expenditures for the entire Dutch population between the years 2006 and 2013. Regional variation in healthcare expenditures is mostly driven by demand factors, with an estimated share around 70%. The most important demand factors are demographics and unobserved individual characteristics. Individual health status, as measured by our indicators, is less important. The relative importance of different causes varies with the groups of regions being compared."
