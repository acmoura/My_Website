abstract = "In the past two decades, many European countries allowed Over-the-Counter (OTC) drugs to be sold outside pharmacies. This was expected to lower retail prices through increased masket competition, as OTC prices are usually not regulated. However, evidence on such price effects is scarce and mostly of a descriptive nature. We assess the causal impact of the entry of supermarkets and non-pharmacy outlets in the OTC market on drug prices, using a differences-in-differences strategy." We use price data on five popular OTC drugs for all points of sale of OTC drugs located in the city of Lisbon at three distinct points in time. Our results show that competitive pressure in the market is mainly exerter by supermarkets, which charge prices 20% lower than pharmacies, on average. The opening of a supermarket among the main competitors of a point of sale leads to an average 3.5% decrease in prices.
