# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Excessive lengths of hospital stay are among the leading sources of inefficiency in healthcare. One reason for excessive lengths of hospital stay is bed-blocking. Bed- blocking occurs when a patient is clinically fit to be discharged but requires some form of support outside the hospital, which is not readily available. The patient remains in the hospital until a safe discharge is possible, resulting in longer lengths of stay. I study whether the entry of subsidized nursing homes (NH) and home care (HC) teams reduces hospital bed-blocking. I use individual data on emergency inpatient admissions at Portuguese hospitals during 2000-2015. My empirical approach exploits variation in the timing of entry of NH and HC teams across regions originating from a policy reform. It also exploits variation in the propensity to bed-block between regular patients and patients who lack support in the community. I find that the entry of HC teams in a region reduces the length of stay of individuals lacking support in the community by 4 days relative to regular patients. These reductions in length of stay do not affect the treatment received while at the hospital nor the likelihood of a readmission. Reductions in length of stay upon the entry of NH occur only for patients with high care needs. The beds freed up by reducing bed-blocking are used to admit additional elective patients."
