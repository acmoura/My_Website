# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Excessive lengths of hospital stay are among the leading sources of inefficiency in healthcare. One reason for excessive lengths of hospital stay is bed-blocking. Bed-blocking occurs when a patient is clinically fit to be discharged but requires some form of support outside the hospital, which is not readily available. The patient remains in the hospital until a safe discharge is possible, resulting in longer lengths of stay.  	I study whether long-term care (LTC) provision reduces hospital bed-blocking. Using individual data on emergency inpatient admissions at Portuguese hospitals during 2000-2015, I implement a triple-differences design. This design exploits variation in the timing of entry of LTC providers across regions originating from the staggered introduction of the public LTC Network. It also exploits variation in lengths of stay between regular patients and patients exhibiting social factors that put them at risk of bed-blocking, such as living alone, having no family to care, and having inadequate housing. I find that the entry of home-care teams in a region reduces the length of stay of individuals living alone and those with inadequate housing by 4 days relative to regular patients. These reductions in length of stay do not affect the treatment received while at the hospital and and are not associated with increased likelihood of a readmission. Reductions in length of stay upon the entry of nursing homes occur only for patients with high care needs. The beds freed up by bed-blockers are used to admit additional elective patients."
