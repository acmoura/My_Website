# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "We assess the relative importance of demand and supply factors as determinants of regional variation in healthcare expenditures in the Netherlands. Our dataset contains individual data on annual healthcare expenditures for the entire Dutch population between the years 2006 and 2013. Our first empirical specifications consists of an event‚Äêstudy analysis, the spirit of [Finkelstein et al. (2016)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/131/4/1681/2468872") . We follow patients over time as they move between different regions in the Netherlands, and we examine how their healthcare expenditures change at the time of move. If regional variation could be entirely attributed to patient characteristics, then healthcare expenditures should not change as patients move from a region with low average healthcare expenditures to a region with high average healthcare expenditures. If, on the other hand, regional variation can be entirely attributed to regional characteristics then we expect individual expenditures to immediately adjust to the level of expenditures in the destination region. If both patients and regional characteristics contribute to regional variation, then the observed change in expenditures upon the move is informative about the relative importance of demand and supply factors. We estimate the relative importance of supply side factors at around 30%: that is the size of the jump in healthcare expenditures around the year of the move in the event-study figure above. Regional variation in healthcare expenditures is therefore mostly driven by demand factors. A second empirical specification based on decomposition methods confirms this result and shows that demographics and other unobserved demand factors, e.g. patient preferences, are important components of the demand share. The relative importance of different causes varies with the groups of regions being compared."

abstract_short = "We assess the relative importance of demand and supply factors as determinants of regional variation in healthcare expenditures in the Netherlands. Our empirical approach follows individuals who migrate between regions. We use individual data on annual healthcare expenditures for the entire Dutch population between the years 2006 and 2013. Regional variation in healthcare expenditures is mostly driven by demand factors, with an estimated share of around 70%. Both demographics and other unobserved demand factors, e.g. patient preferences, are important components of the demand share. The relative importance of different causes varies with the groups of regions being compared."
